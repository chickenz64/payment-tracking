## Payment Tracking
Is a Rails application used by my dad. 
He has clients who purchase products and pay in installments, 
so this app mainly keeps track of clients and remaining payments for each of the purchased products, 
also shows some statistics and pretty graphs.

Here's a [live demo](http://payment-tracking.herokuapp.com/), but you need login details - 
so feel free to ask me if you want to play around.
(Don't worry about editing things since it's a separate demo database and not the one my dad uses, of course)
